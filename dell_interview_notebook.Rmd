<!-- First step: load libraries, set working directory and read the dataset from csv file -->

```{r include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(xtable)
setwd("C://Users//sprot//Documents//Repos//dellDemo")
getwd()
laptopsDf1 = read.csv('laptops.csv')
```
## Case 1: some quick filtering

Print a few rows to see if the data was imported correctly

```{r echo=FALSE}
laptopsDf1 %>%
  filter(X <= 10) %>% kable(format = 'simple')
```


I want to see laptops that fulfill all of the requirements below:

1) at least 16GB of RAM

2) have SSD

3) Lighter than 2kg

4) under 1350 Euros:

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
evenBetterDeal = highRamLowPrice %>%
  mutate(weightKg =  as.numeric(gsub("[^0-9.]", "", Weight))) %>% 
  filter(grepl('SSD', Memory),
         Weight < 2)

evenBetterDeal %>%
  select(Company, Product, Ram, Memory, Weight, Price_euros) %>%
  kable(format = 'simple')
```



## Case 2: A simple grouping by marketing channel

This is what the raw data looks like:

```{r}
leadsDf1 = read.csv('olist_marketing_qualified_leads_dataset.csv')

kable(head(leadsDf1,10), format = 'simple')

leadsCountByOrigin = leadsDf1 %>%
  group_by(origin) %>%
  count()
```

Now, the number of leads by itself do not tell us much, unless we have a cost estimate for each of these marketing channels. Let's assume some spending for each

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
leadsCountByOrigin2 = leadsCountByOrigin %>%
  mutate(total_cost = runif(1, 9999, 49999),
         leads_per_thousand_dollars = n*1000 / total_cost) %>%
  filter(origin != '') 

kable(leadsCountByOrigin2, format = 'simple')
```


## Case 3: Who should we target? Who is more likely to spend more?

This is what the raw data looks like:

```{r warning=FALSE}
retailMarketingDf1 = read.csv('retailMarketingDI.csv')
kable(head(retailMarketingDf1,10), format = 'simple')

```

Let's convert categorical data into numeric, so we can include them when checking correlations

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
retailMarketingLevels = retailMarketingDf1 %>% 
  mutate(
    Age = case_when(
      tolower(Age)=='young'~ 1,
      tolower(Age)=='middle'~ 2,
      tolower(Age)=='old'~ 3
      ),
    Gender = case_when(
      tolower(Gender) == 'male' ~ 0,
      tolower(Gender) == 'female' ~ 1
    ),
    OwnHome = case_when(
      tolower(OwnHome) == 'rent' ~ 0,
      tolower(OwnHome) == 'own' ~ 1
    ),
      Married = case_when(
      tolower(Married) == 'married' ~ 1,
      TRUE ~ 0
    ),
        Location = case_when(
      tolower(Location) == 'close' ~ 0,
      tolower(Location) == 'far' ~ 1
    ),
        History = case_when(
      tolower(History) == 'low' ~ 1,
      tolower(History) == 'medium' ~ 2,
      tolower(History) == 'high' ~ 3
    )
  )
```

Now that we prepared the data, let's create a correlation plot:

```{r}
myCorrelations = cor(retailMarketingLevels, use="complete.obs")

corrplot::corrplot(myCorrelations)
```

We are trying to predict who is more likely to spend more:

The strongest positive correlation (predictor for spending more) are the size of Salary and the History with the company.
Some negative corrlatation can be found with the number of children: people with more children tend to spend less.
Women tend to spend a little less than men on our products, but the correlation is not very strong so we should not take that for granted, more of a possibility to re-test in the future with more data.
Married  people also seem to spend more than single.

So, our target would be: Higher income married couples.
We should make sure to engage our existing customers (have history with us) as they tend to spend more on average than new customers.
